My journey into software engineering and all the projects I build along the way

## Who I Am
I’m a builder, strategist, and problem solver with a mind wired for structure and improvement. 
Currently shifting into software engineering with my son as part of a 12-month journey.

## What This Repository Is For
This repo will track:
- My learning progress
- My monthly goals
- My projects (Python, JavaScript, React, Node.js)
- My full-stack capstone app

## The Plan
Month 1–3: Foundations (Python, HTML, CSS, JS)  
Month 4–6: Frontend apps + deployment  
Month 7–9: Backend + databases  
Month 10–12: Full-stack project + portfolio v2  

This is the starting point.
